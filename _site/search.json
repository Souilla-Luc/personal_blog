    "text": "Academic Journey\n\n\nFrom exercise physiologist to research 🔍\nWhen I began my studies at the sports science university in Toulouse, France, in 2016, it marked the first time my academic pursuits took precedence over my ambitions in competitive sports. I gained insights into how my body regulates itself during an effort and learned to optimize it for peak performance. Most importantly, I discovered how physical activty can help others to lead healthier and happier lives.\nBy 2019, I had graduated as an exercise physiologist and was eager to explore the connection between physical activity and health benefits. Through various internships and summer jobs, my interest in research grew, particularly in understanding complex mechanisms and interactions, as well as evaluating how different exercise programs can yield various physiological effects. This led me to pursue, a research master’s degree focused on exercise rehabilitation and health benefits at the University of Montpellier.\nBy 2020, I started a one-year internship in the pediatric cardiology Department of University Hospital of Montpellier, working with children and adolescents who had inherited cardiac diseases and were disqualified from sports and restricted from physical activity to prevent cardiac events. Initially, I found this situation unjust and complicated, given how physical activity shaped my childhood.\nIn 2021, I received a PhD scholarship to continue exploring this research question, aiming to pave a new path for managing these children by (a) describing their concerning levels of physical activity and fitness compared to healthy children, and (b) creating a cardiac rehabilitation program tailored to each child’s condition and disease status, encouraging long-term physical activity. After three years, I graduated with a Ph.D. in 2024.\n\n\nSo, what about climate change then? 🌍\nUpon entering university, I became increasingly conscious of the challenges that climate change presents and recognized the vital role the younger generation must play in taking action. Embarking on my research during my master’s program offered an excellent chance to investigate this issue more thoroughly. I came to understand that science is founded on evidence and rigorous methodology, which led me to question why experts express such alarm over the climate crisis we are currently experiencing.\nDuring my PhD, I collaborated with researchers to investigate how global warming might pose a threat to health, particularly affecting the cardiovascular system in children with heart diseases. By the end of my PhD, it became clear that shifting my research focus towards the detrimental impacts of climate change on human health was a logical step as I continued my academic journey. I also took personal actions such as eating locally, avoiding air travel, gardening, calculating my personal carbon footprint, and participating in community awareness workshops and associations.\nI was fortunate to start a postdoc position at the Montreal Heart Institute, where I studied how the human body reacts to heat exposure, an increasingly relevant topic given the current and future scenarios of global warming. Building on my PhD work, I aim to investigate how vulnerable groups such as children can face the challenges imposed by global warming.\nFor years, I have been engaged in teaching students and sharing scientific results with the broader community, making complex scientific findings more accessible. Check my blog, where I present visual and text summaries in plain language on environmental challenges related to climate change, human body responses, and health issues."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background. The evaluation of health status by cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) has shown increasing interest in the paediatric population. Our group recently established reference Z-score values for paediatric cycle ergometer VO2max, applicable to normal and extreme weights, from a cohort of 1141 healthy children. There are currently no validated reference values for the other CPET parameters in the paediatric population. This study aimed to establish, from the same cohort, reference Z-score values for the main paediatric cycle ergometer CPET parameters, apart from VO2max.\nResults. In this cross-sectional study, 909 healthy children aged 5–18 years old underwent a CPET. Linear, quadratic, and polynomial mathematical regression equations were applied to identify the best CPET parameters Z-scores, according to anthropometric parameters (sex, age, height, weight, and BMI). This study provided Z-scores for maximal CPET parameters (heart rate, respiratory exchange ratio, workload, and oxygen pulse), submaximal CPET parameters (ventilatory anaerobic threshold, VE/VCO2 slope, and oxygen uptake efficiency slope), and maximum ventilatory CPET parameters (tidal volume, respiratory rate, breathing reserve, and ventilatory equivalent for CO2 and O2).\nConclusions. This study defined paediatric reference Z-score values for the main cycle ergometer CPET parameters, in addition to the existing reference values for VO2max, applicable to children of normal and extreme weights. Providing Z-scores for CPET parameters in the paediatric population should be useful in the follow-up of children with various chronic diseases. Thus, new paediatric research fields are opening up, such as prognostic studies and clinical trials using cardiopulmonary fitness outcomes."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background. In children with congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), the risk of arrhythmic events during exercise commonly makes it difficult to balance exercise restrictions versus promotion of physical activity. Nevertheless, in children with LQTS, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle fitness, and physical activity, have been scarcely explored.\nMethods. In this prospective, controlled, cross-sectional study, 20 children with LQTS (12.7 ± 3.7 years old) and 20 healthy controls (11.9 ± 2.4 years old) were enrolled. All participants underwent a cardiopulmonary exercise test, a muscular architecture ultrasound assessment, (cross-sectional area on right rectus femoris and pennation angle), a handgrip muscular strength evaluation, and a standing long broad jump test. The level of physical activity was determined using with a waist-worn tri-axial accelerometer (Actigraph GT3X).\nResults. Peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) and ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) were lower in children with LQTS than in healthy controls (33.9 ± 6.2 mL/Kg/min vs. 40.1 ± 6.6 mL/Kg/min, P = 0.010; 23.8 ± 5.1 mL/Kg/min vs. 28.8 ± 5.5 mL/Kg/min, P = 0.007, respectively). Children with LQTS had lower standing long broad jump distance (119.5 ± 33.2 cm vs. 147.3 ± 36.1 cm, P = 0.02) and pennation angle (12.2 ± 2.4° vs. 14.3 ± 2.8°, P = 0.02). No differences in terms of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were observed (36.9 ± 12.9 min/day vs. 41.5 ± 18.7 min/day, P = 0.66), but nearly all children were below the WHO guidelines.\nConclusions. Despite similar physical activity level, cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle fitness in children with LQTS were lower than in healthy controls. The origin of this limitation seemed to be multifactorial, involving beta-blocker induced chronotropic limitation, physical and muscle deconditioning. Cardiovascular rehabilitation could be of interest in children with LQTS with significant physical limitation.\n\n\n\nA graphical overview of the study (french)."

In children with congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), the risk of arrhythmic events during exercise commonly makes it difficult to balance exercise restrictions versus promotion of physical activity.

As the standard of care seems insufficient to encourage and maintain fitness, an early hybrid cardiac rehabilitation programme could improve HRQoL in CHD.\nMethods. The QUALIREHAB multicentre, randomized, controlled trial evaluated and implemented a 12-week centre- and home-based hybrid cardiac rehabilitation programme, including multidisciplinary care and physical activity sessions. Adolescent and young adult CHD patients with impaired cardiopulmonary fitness were randomly assigned to either the intervention (i.e. cardiac rehabilitation) or the standard of care. The primary outcome was the change in HRQoL from baseline to 12-month follow-up in an intention-to-treat analysis. The secondary outcomes were the change in cardiovascular parameters, cardiopulmonary fitness, and mental health.\nResults. The expected number of 142 patients was enroled in the study (mean age 17.4 ± 3.4 years, 52% female). Patients assigned to the intervention had a significant positive change in HRQoL total score [mean difference 3.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2; 7.3; P = .038; effect size 0.34], body mass index [mean difference −0.7 kg/m2 (95% CI −1.3; −0.1); P = .022; effect size 0.41], level of physical activity [mean difference 2.5 (95% CI 0.1; 5); P = .044; effect size 0.39], and disease knowledge [mean difference 2.7 (95% CI 0.8; 4.6); P = .007; effect size 0.51]. The per-protocol analysis confirmed these results with a higher magnitude of differences. Acceptability, safety, and short-time effect of the intervention were good to excellent.\nConclusions. This early hybrid cardiac rehabilitation programme improved HRQoL, body mass index, physical activity, and disease knowledge, in youth with CHD, opening up the possibility for the QUALIREHAB programme to be rolled out to the adult population of CHD and non-congenital cardiac disease.\n\n\n\nA graphical overview of the study."

Such observations pave the way for studying heat-based interventions in contexts such as ageing, injury rehabilitation, spaceflight countermeasures and clinical conditions marked by musculoskeletal decline, where preventing muscle atrophy is especially critical. Their study also set the stage for future research to determine the optimal conditions under which heat therapy can translate molecular benefits into functional gains over long-term periods."

    "text": "A direct consequence of climate change is the occurrence of extreme heat events, which are becoming increasingly frequent and intense. Extreme heat pose a a threat to human health. Since extreme heat events will continue to intensify in the coming years, it is essential to understand how heat affects human health to minimize its consequences.\nMost studies conducted so far have focused on outdoor temperatures or controlled environments that do not accurately represent daily life, such as laboratory studies. Indoor temperatures can vary significantly from outdoor temperatures owing to multiple factors, including building characteristics, time of day, and the presence of air conditioning systems. Therefore, monitoring behavioral and bodily responses to rising indoor temperatures offers a more realistic and representative approach to daily life. This method allows for a more precise assessment of the effects of heat on health and quality of life.\nThe objective of this study is to identify an indoor temperature threshold at which behavioral and bodily responses are affected during hot weather. The results will help to:\n-1) establish a link between indoor heat and associated health risks by monitoring physiological and behavioral variables; -2) better understand how humidity, housing characteristics, and personal factors contribute to increased health risks; -3) recommend strategies to minimize health risks associated with heat exposure."
