## Paper Summary

**Main findings: ** Rising temperatures in Gaza, worsened by climate change and conflict, can significantly increase heat-related health risks, especially among vulnerable populations.

**Added knowledge: ** This article emphasizes how the interplay of environmental degradation, violence, and a collapsing healthcare system amplifies the threat of extreme heat in Gaza.

**Global health impacts for policy and action: ** Immediate preventive measures and long-term strategies are essential to mitigate these risks and enhance a regionâ€™s resilience to extreme heat.
