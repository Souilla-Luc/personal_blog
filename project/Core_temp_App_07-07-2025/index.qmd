## Purpose of the Core Temp App

[The Core Temp App](https://luc-souilla.shinyapps.io/Body_Temp_App/) is designed for researchers (e.g., physiologists) and health professionals using [Body Cap](https://www.bodycap-medical.com/e-celsius-performance-body-temperature-monitoring-telemetric-pill/) pills to monitor body core temperature. This tool is particularly useful for analyzing temperature data across different conditions (e.g., hot vs. neutral environments) and/or time periods (e.g., baseline â€“ exercise â€“ recovery).

## How Does It Work?

Currently, only `.csv` files generated by the Body Cap software are supported. The app follows a four-step process:

1. **Upload & Select Pills** â€“ Upload your data and choose which pill(s) to analyze.  
2. **Set Time Periods** â€“ Define time intervals of interest (e.g., baseline, exercise, rest).  
3. **Visual Inspection** â€“ Explore plots to identify anomalies or missing data.  
4. **Export Summary** â€“ Download a `.tsv` file containing the mean, standard deviation (SD), and number of measurements for each selected period.

This workflow allows users to efficiently filter, analyze, and summarize temperature data.

This is my first time building a Shiny app and I opted to host on shinyapps.io. I have my fingers crossed that the free tier will be enough to handle the traffic! ðŸ¤ž
