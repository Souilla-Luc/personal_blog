## Purpose of the Core Temp App

[This reposit](https://github.com/Souilla-Luc/CPET_COSMED) is designed for exercise physiologists, health professionals, or any professionals using CPET [COSMED](https://www.cosmed.com/en/) software to help report CPET data in preprint medical reports. It improves the reliability of report data and offers an easy feature to individualize your personal medical report according to the variables of interest. 


## How Does It Work?

1. Install Scilab on your computer.

2. Make sure that CPET software is COSMED

3. Clone or download the repository and convert .xlsx generated by COSMED in .xls, and drag it in `DAT`

4. Do not modify the names or organization of the directories. The `DAT`+`PRG`+`RES` structure is expected when initializing in `InitTRT.sce`

5. On your computer, open `main.sce` then run the script with `F5` or click the button with grey triangle. In this script, you can personalized your report according of your need 

6. If you want to have additional information, read this [document](https://github.com/Souilla-Luc/CPET_COSMED/blob/main/DOC/Read_me_longer.pdf) or watch this [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/T9ShSF8CeLk)
