title: "Bringing science to the community"
description: |
  This is my blog where I aim to bridge the gap between scientific findings and the wider community.<br>
  Most of the time, you'll find visual explanations, accessible summaries, and articles â€”created both as a reference for my future self and <br> (hopefully) as a helpful resource for you too.<br><br>
